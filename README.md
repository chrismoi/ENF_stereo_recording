# ENF-Sensing-Devices-For-Video-Forensics
This is a Matlab implementation for the 2-channel "stereo" recording of the device proposed in ENF-Sensing-Devices-For-Video-Forensics conference paper.

# Script execution

Information about the devices developed can be found in ENF-Sensing-Devices-For-Video-Forensics paper. In order to run record_data.m, the 3.5mm jack should be inserted as a 'Line input' device.
